# NAAN-MUDHALVAN-HEART-PRED

Project Overview

Heart disease is a significant health concern globally, leading to high mortality rates. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project aims to develop machine learning models for heart disease prediction by leveraging advanced techniques in data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model selection.

Problem Statement

Traditional risk assessment methods for heart disease may not fully utilize available data or provide precise predictions. Hence, there is a necessity to employ advanced machine learning techniques to enhance prediction accuracy and facilitate early intervention.

Abstract

Heart disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide, emphasizing the need for accurate prediction and early intervention. In this project, we propose a machine learning-based approach for heart disease prediction. We employ various preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, and multiple machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F2 score are used to assess the performance of each model. Through comprehensive analysis and comparison, we aim to identify the most effective predictive model for heart disease.

Objectives

1) Develop a robust preprocessing pipeline to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
2) Employ feature extraction techniques, such as correlation analysis, to identify the most relevant features for heart disease prediction.
3) Explore various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, for building predictive models.
4) Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F2 score.
5) Compare the effectiveness of different algorithms and identify the best-performing model for heart disease prediction.

Proposed Work

The project involves the following steps:

Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset containing relevant features associated with heart disease, including demographic information, medical history, and diagnostic test results.

Preprocessing: Implement preprocessing techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and normalize features. Replace null values with mean values to ensure data integrity.

Feature Extraction: Conduct correlation analysis to identify the most significant features correlated with heart disease. Select relevant features for model training to improve prediction accuracy.

Model Training: Utilize various machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, to develop predictive models. Optimize model parameters to enhance performance.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of each model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F2 score. Plot graphs to visualize the performance comparison across different algorithms.

Model Selection: Identify the most effective predictive model based on evaluation metrics and graphical analysis. Choose the model with the highest predictive accuracy and suitable trade-offs between precision, recall, and F2 score.

Validation and Deployment: Validate the selected model using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and generalization. Deploy the final model in a real-world setting for heart disease prediction.
